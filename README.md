# D3 visualizations for Aidata

The following visualizations are developed in D3.js to answer various questions on Aidata.

## Questions

### Question 1 
### How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and donate from other countries? Are there countries that donate much more than they receive or receive much more than they donate?

Explanation: In this visualization I have considered the top 30 countires that donated and top 30 countires that receive. We see that developing countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, China, etc. receive the maximum amount of aid. Whereas developed nations like United States, Germany, Japan, France, etc. give more donations. The comparison between countries that donate more and that receive more is easy in this graph as there are 2 axis, one for donated amount and one for received amount. This allows us to compare large number of countries in a single chart. The diverging bars, along with different color for donated amount and received amount help to easily distinguish between the countries and answer the
question. I have not considered all the countries as the amount scale is in billions and some of the countries have received or donated in millions which would not have a visible bar on the chart. So to maintain relevance and answer the question effectively, I have only considered the top 30 donating and receiving countries. So counntries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, China, Turkey receive much more than they donate and USA, Japan France, Germany, United Kingdom donate much more than they receive.

### Question 2
### Do the countries that receive and donate the most tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world? Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs. how much they donate?

Explanation: In the above chart I used the color scheme as, when the donated amount is greater than the recevied amount then the color is red, and when the
received amount is more then the color is blue. The size encodes the absolute difference between the amount donated and the amount received in $ Billion. So we see that the countries that donate more are United States, European Nations like Germany, France, Netherlans, UK, Spain. In Asia we see Japan having significant donations. Australia and New Zealand also have more donated aid in south pacific region. Developing Countries in Asia and South America like, India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina recieve most of the aid. None of the countries in Africa give major donations and mostly received the aid. We see contrast in North America where US donates the maximum aid and Mexico recevies a considerable amount of aid. Similarly we see that western european nations donate more while the eastern europen nations receive more. In Aisa Japan gives a high amount of donations, while its neighbours like China, Phillipine or Russia receive the aid. We also see that middle eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait give more donations.
